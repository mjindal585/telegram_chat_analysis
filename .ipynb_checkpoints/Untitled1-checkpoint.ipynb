I could notice that when I left my text data unprocessed ( without doing any text cleaning), my simple roberta- base gives my better score because there\\'s one of  parameters of this model called \"reprocessing_input_data\" which I set to TRUE. And another one \"do_lower_case\" which I also set to TRUE. But in all, I am still not satisfied with my final score from this model. So I am wondering how best can we do a simple text cleaning to assist the performance of this simple transformer ( Roberta-base or even roberta-large as well) in order to improve my Log_loss score. My colleagues had improved their scores to Log_loss = 0.28 with the aid of text cleaning method(which is unknown to me) to assist this model performance. I heard that not all usual method of text preprocessing will work for this simple transformer ( Roberta-base or large) because it has it\\'s own way of reprocessing input data but however one can still do a bit of text reprocessing on his own to aid the model performance. My Log_loss stuck at 0.37 without any personal text preprocessing or cleaning. The project is based on Multi label text classification. \\nHow best can I do text cleaning to aid this simple Roberta-base/ large model knowingfully well that it has it\\'s own embedded method of reprocessing input data through parameters called \"reprocessing_input_data\" and \"do_lower_case\" respectively.\\nI will like to hear from you the trick behind this because I know that you understood this Roberta architecture very well. \\nHere\\'s my Gmail: ', {'type': 'email', 'text': 'sotundeadeyinka@gmail.com'}, ' for any response on this.\\nApart from YouTube, I also follow you on telegram where we discuss so many things on data science.\\nBut I will love to hear from you wether in private, personal via my Gmail or via this telegram discussion platform right here.\\nI know this might be a resounding breakthrough on this project for every one on this data science journey.\\n \\nThanks.'\n",

Similarly its ok with Type 1 error in covid case, as detecting non covid patient as covid patient may not lead to any severe issue, it is just that patient will take extra care as the patient may b in impression that he/she is suffering from covid \\nHope that helps u clear ur understanding :)'\n",

For data scientist who deployed the model, his hypothesis would be that new model will improve sales than old model or old way of doing things. Let's assume that model increased sales by 2 percent. Hypothesis testing or statistical significance testing will tell whether the 2 percent increase in sales is due to luck or chance or is it really model has caused this outcome/effect.\n",

Next coming to project they mostly ask about model metrics (for ex precision, recall,..etc ) for both regression and classification problem. You should be very clear on that.. One common question is bias varience trade off....They may ask about the model you have used in your project like explain your model..like this. And they will mostly focused on your project only....

      "7157 : Having data in range of your normal distribution...it just ensures...that your data is in proper range...there are no outliers in your data ..cause having any outlier...can affect the accuracy\n",
      "7158 : If it doesn’t follow bell curve. \n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose I have data which have curve like M ( 2 top and  one low )\n",
      "7159 : What it is telling\n",

      "7161 : Examples:  I have data where I have ppl are participating with their age 10-15 - 40% .... age of 16-30 - 10% and above 30 age - 50% \n",

      "Here if we draw a graph then we don’t have bell curve ( participants based on age )\n",
      "7162 : What can we draw as an output from this graph? Is it mean we have outliers ?\n",
      "7163 : It's not necessary your graph would be or should be a bell curve, generally in case of outliers we try to normal out the distribution or use a boxcox transformation. If you data has more than one relevant peaks it's totally okay. You could look into GMM's, they are great at dealing with these types.\n",

      "7945 :  It depends on use case Ishita . Sometimes Type 1 error is more critical and sometimes type 2 error is critical..\\n\\nfor example, in case of spam detection, predicting non spam as spam is not acceptable as we may lose some important mails which are falsely detected as spam. This type of error is called False Positive, i,e Type 1 error, which is not acceptable at all as we dont want to lose some important mail which are falsely classified as spam , at the same type its ok to compromise with type 2 error, coz detectig spam as not spam may not lead to loss of information, it is just that the spam mail will get added to not spam folder..\\nIn second case, for example, covid detection, diagnosing covid patient as negative, which means, not suffering from covid, is highly dangerous, as the patient may nt take proper care medication to cure themselves as they were told that they are not suffering from covid. this is very dangerous error, tis type of error is called as false negative, which means patient has been falsely detected as not suffering from covid, which is also called as False Negative, In this scenario, Type 2 error is more severe. Similarly its ok with Type 1 error in covid case, as detecting non covid patient as covid patient may not lead to any severe issue, it is just that patient will take extra care as the patient may b in impression that he/she is suffering from covid \\nHope that helps u clear ur understanding :)\n",
