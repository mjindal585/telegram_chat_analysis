career in data science..wondering..wat is the road map?..doing a certificate Nd going fr fantasy models is not the ideal way.. even when I started to learn I was very curious to learn these fancy stuffs..but later came to know that this is not the ideal way to start a career in ds..As Krish mentioned start doing creating models and learn by reverse engineering..but most of the guys missed the word from what Krish has said understanding the basics first..? then go for creating the models.. understanding the basics seems like a simple sentence.. but actually it is the most important stuff in ds..understand folks.. you never know there may be some languages which can replace python and there can be algorithms which can replace CNN,rnn,Bert.and all other ML,DP learning algorithms.but no one can replace the inference of CLT, probability distributions,SD,Bayes theorem,hypothesis testing,linear algebra,conditional probability etc. Try to spend some time on basics then start doing others stuffs, there are play list from Krish to start with statistics,EDA..this is wat I have learned from past 8 months..even am an enthusiast.guys who are willing a start a career in ds hope have got some basic idea..Thank you.."},"2369":{"id":12415,"type":"service","date":"2020-06-17T07:31:46","actor":"Ashutosh Singh","actor_id":775415498,"action":"join_group_by_link","inviter":"Krish

I could notice that when I left my text data unprocessed ( without doing any text cleaning), my simple roberta- base gives my better score because there's one of  parameters of this model called \"reprocessing_input_data\" which I set to TRUE. And another one \"do_lower_case\" which I also set to TRUE. But in all, I am still not satisfied with my final score from this model. So I am wondering how best can we do a simple text cleaning to assist the performance of this simple transformer ( Roberta-base or even roberta-large as well) in order to improve my Log_loss score. My colleagues had improved their scores to Log_loss = 0.28 with the aid of text cleaning method(which is unknown to me) to assist this model performance. I heard that not all usual method of text preprocessing will work for this simple transformer ( Roberta-base or large) because it has it's own way of reprocessing input data but however one can still do a bit of text reprocessing on his own to aid the model performance. My Log_loss stuck at 0.37 without any personal text preprocessing or cleaning. The project is based on Multi label text classification. \nHow best can I do text cleaning to aid this simple Roberta-base\/ large model knowingfully well that it has it's own embedded method of reprocessing input data through parameters called \"reprocessing_input_data\" and \"do_lower_case\" respectively.\nI will like to hear from you the trick behind this because I know that you understood this Roberta architecture very well. \nHere's my Gmail: ",{"type":"email","text":"sotundeadeyinka@gmail.com"}," for any response on this.\nApart from YouTube, I also follow you on telegram where we discuss so many things on data science.\nBut I will love to hear from you wether in private, personal via my Gmail or via this telegram discussion platform right here.\nI know this might be a resounding breakthrough on this project for every one on this data science journey.\n \nThanks."]},"4514":{"id":14701,"type":"service","date":"2020-06-18T13:12:11","actor":"Sejal Chandra","actor_id":950981614,"action":"invite_members","members":["Sejal Chandra"],"text":""},"4515":{"id":14702,"type":"service","date":"2020-06-18T13:12:16","actor":"Jai","actor_id":1060979789,"action":"invite_members","members":["Jai"],"text":""},"4516":{"id":14703,"type":"service","date":"2020-06-18T13:14:14","actor":"Akash Poddar","actor_id":1223266082,"action":"invite_members","members":["Akash Poddar"],"text":""},"4517":{"id":14704,"type":"service","date":"2020-06-18T13:17:47","actor":"Kuldeep Sharma","actor_id":920812535,"action":"invite_members","members":["Kuldeep Sharma"],"text":""},"4518":{"id":14705,"type":"service","date":"2020-06-18T13:27:40","actor":"Anand K ABK","actor_id":991621231,"action":"invite_members","members":["Anand K ABK"],"text":""},"4519":{"id":14706,"type":"message","date":"2020-06-18T13:27:54","from":"Akash","from_id":1003506474,"forwarded_from":"Akash","text":[{"type":"link","text":"github.com\/Akash-Lad"},"\n\nRecently started my GitHub profile.

Next coming to project they mostly ask about model metrics (for ex precision, recall,..etc ) for both regression and classification problem. You should be very clear on that.. One common question is bias varience trade off....They may ask about the model you have used in your project like explain your model..like this. And they will mostly focused on your project only.... Next they give you some case studies you have to provide a solution for that ( in this type of question approach is more important than solution). They may ask about guess estimation and puzzles...

Why? Because you can develop relationship with them and when you have relationship especially with the higher-ups, you can get a raise, you are seen, that is the most important part. When you have a relation with someone, you will learn a lot especially with the positive people, plus you can get lots of help, thanks to nepotism \/ favouritism. The higher-ups will know whether you are a golden apple or not when you are purely motivated and driven without helps of others and money. In here the fact you are going there just to help, really make others think twice.\n\nBut here is the requirement to make sure it is a success, the community there isn\u2019t all messed up (dull in management, talent), you must focus on developing relationship, you are highly driven and are a high performer (Highly driven and performing is something that is rare), you must focus on delivering value which sometimes is exhausting and lastly is to make sure that you can scale your income there, whether it is long term or short term. You also need to counter fear.\n\nThis is a brief road path to success, if you are unable to achieve those, simply means that you won\u2019t be able maximise the meter of success. The trouble I have with this assumption is that I don\u2019t know whether it is realistic or not cuz I\u2019m not in the workforce yet.\n\nOne more thing, three months might be a lot, maybe you can somehow ask for them maybe after showing them your talent."},"10020":{"id":20775,"type":"message","date":"2020-07-03T19:27:54","from":"Calvin Khoo","from_id":1265776224,"reply_to_message_id":20774,"text":"If someone can disprove that, that would be great, I'm having trouble for it's realistic meter"},"10021":{"id":20776,"type":"message","date":"2020-07-03T19:28:04","from":"Calvin Khoo","from_id":1265776224,"text":"*with"},"10022":{"id":20777,"type":"service","date":"2020-07-03T19:33:58","actor":"Imaad Khan","actor_id":805741061,"action":"invite_members","members":["Imaad Khan"],"text":""},"10023":{"id":20778,"type":"message","date":"2020-07-03T19:43:18","from":"Sumit Dalmiya","from_id":774269369,"text":["Hi friends ,let's connect with my strong linkedin network as Krish mentioned in today's session and grow together :\n",{"type":"link","text":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/sumit-dalmiya"}]},"10024":{"id":20779,"type":"message","date":"2020-07-03T19:51:56","from":"V","from_id":821304328,"text":"Hii Guys, I am trying to do prediction on restaurant reviews dataset .where there are dates within the text in a square brackets.

Sometimes Type 1 error is more critical and sometimes type 2 error is critical..\n\nfor example, in case of spam detection, predicting non spam as spam is not acceptable as we may lose some important mails which are falsely detected as spam. This type of error is called False Positive, i,e Type 1 error, which is not acceptable at all as we dont want to lose some important mail which are falsely classified as spam , at the same type its ok to compromise with type 2 error, coz detectig spam as not spam may not lead to loss of information, it is just that the spam mail will get added to not spam folder..\nIn second case, for example, covid detection, diagnosing covid patient as negative, which means, not suffering from covid, is highly dangerous, as the patient may nt take proper care medication to cure themselves as they were told that they are not suffering from covid. this is very dangerous error, tis type of error is called as false negative, which means patient has been falsely detected as not suffering from covid, which is also called as False Negative, In this scenario, Type 2 error is more severe. Similarly its ok with Type 1 error in covid case, as detecting non covid patient as covid patient may not lead to any severe issue, it is just that patient will take extra care as the patient may b in impression that he\/she is suffering from covid \nHope that helps u clear ur understanding :)"]},"11166":{"id":21986,"type":"service","date":"2020-07-07T19:39:42","actor":"jaganinfo jaganinfo","actor_id":1278840059,"action":"invite_members","members":["jaganinfo jaganinfo"],"text":""},"11167":{"id":21987,"type":"message","date":"2020-07-07T19:40:55","from":"B M","from_id":997015489,"text":"In this picture this is type 1 error.."},"11168":{"id":21988,"type":"message","date":"2020-07-07T19:41:00","from":"Sanjay","from_id":968998437,"text":"Can anyone tell me what kind of data science projects should be in resume for freshers?"},"11169":{"id":21989,"type":"message","date":"2020-07-07T19:41:54","from":"B M","from_id":997015489,"reply_to_message_id":21985,"photo":"(File not included.

You need to know that and only then evaluate."},"11649":{"id":22489,"type":"message","date":"2020-07-09T11:01:02","from":"Chayan Kathuria","from_id":1052881474,"reply_to_message_id":22461,"text":"You cannot do anything useful in NLP if you dont know Deep Learning stuff like the RNN, LSTM and more complex stuff like BERT"},"11650":{"id":22490,"type":"message","date":"2020-07-09T11:03:22","from":"Wisam","from_id":692929936,"text":"I want a data set taken using the Internet of Things, for example pictures in the field of industry or medicine, to be pictures then applied ml\/dl"},"11651":{"id":22491,"type":"message","date":"2020-07-09T11:04:38","from":"Kim Hoe Low","from_id":1254013838,"reply_to_message_id":22489,"text":"Understand your point.
