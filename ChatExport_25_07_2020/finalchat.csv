I have a data set with 10 columns, all of them are categorical in nature. I have done missing value treatment, outlier treatment and label encoding to convert from categorical to numerical data type.
Can someone help me with what approach to I need to take further to draw inferences from this data and make a ML algorithm? I have recently started working on ML and I am still learning, hence the ask. 

I know we cannot directly use .corr() using pearsons method on categorical variables, neither will linear regression work here. Logistic regression may be? Can some one point me in the right direction here? any help, suggestions, even links to articles would be highly appreciated.

1. You can generate few images using data augmentation.
2. Then use a convolutional nueral network, and extract the dense vector for each and every image after training....for analysis

‚Ä¢ Emergency 911 
‚Ä¢ Alice 97 625 999 
‚Ä¢ Bob 91 12 54 26 
In this case, it‚Äôs not possible to call Bob, because the central would direct your call to the emergency  
line as soon as you had dialled the first three digits of Bob‚Äôs phone number. So this list would not  
be consistent. 
Input 
The first line of input gives a single integer, 1 <= t <= 40, the number of test cases. Each test case  
starts withn, the number of phone numbers, on a separate line, 1 <= n <= 10000. Then  
follows n lines with one unique phone number on each line. A phone number is a sequence of at  
most ten digits.

I tried to understand very hard why it was happening, tried all the optimization process but little to no progress. My professor took one look at my work and through the confusion matrix he understood that the data was skewed because he was very good in reading and understanding data. I fixed that and my accuracy went up to 90%. So understanding data is very important. Im not from stat background so I still struggle through it. But I get better everyday by giving equal time to stats.",,,

Let's say, we have trained a model on a dataset and evaluate it and got 90% accuracy. 

When we retrain the model again with the same dataset and evaluate it, the accuracy changes. 

It's because the ML algo's shuffle the dataset while training. And that shuffling is based on a random number sequence. 

So, every time the model is trained, the random number sequence varies and the steps vary in the gradient descent (order of steps). Which leads to a different optimums, which implies a change in accuracy.
 
To evaluate a model in a right way, we should set the seed, so that same sequence is generated every time,and we can focus on other (hyper parameter tuning, etc)",19831.0,,

Next coming to project they mostly ask about model metrics (for ex precision, recall,..etc ) for both regression and classification problem. You should be very clear on that.. One common question is bias varience trade off....They may ask about the model you have used in your project like explain your model..like this. And they will mostly focused on your project only.... Next they give you some case studies you have to provide a solution for that ( in this type of question approach is more important than solution). They may ask about guess estimation and puzzles...

Because you can develop relationship with them and when you have relationship especially with the higher-ups, you can get a raise, you are seen, that is the most important part. When you have a relation with someone, you will learn a lot especially with the positive people, plus you can get lots of help, thanks to nepotism / favouritism. The higher-ups will know whether you are a golden apple or not when you are purely motivated and driven without helps of others and money. In here the fact you are going there just to help, really make others think twice.

But here is the requirement to make sure it is a success, the community there isn‚Äôt all messed up (dull in management, talent), you must focus on developing relationship, you are highly driven and are a high performer (Highly driven and performing is something that is rare), you must focus on delivering value which sometimes is exhausting and lastly is to make sure that you can scale your income there, whether it is long term or short term. You also need to counter fear.

This is a brief road path to success, if you are unable to achieve those, simply means that you won‚Äôt be able maximise the meter of success. The trouble I have with this assumption is that I don‚Äôt know whether it is realistic or not cuz I‚Äôm not in the workforce yet.

(Problem statement)\n\nIngredients: ( Data collection)\nBasumathi Rice 3 KGs.\nGaram masala, Ghee, Onion, Ginger, Garlic, Oil and other required elements.\nIn data analysis, we collect all required features.\n\nPre cooking process (data pre processing)\nClean vegetables, soak rice, cut the vegetables in required shape etc\nIn data analysis, we do outleir detection, handle missing values, transfer feature, extract new features etc.\n\nYour induction stove, vessels are tools to make Biryani, similarly, python, R, SQL are tools to do models.\n\nCooking process is like model building.\n\nTasting and making correction to your biryani is model tuning.\n\nServing in nice crockery with some decorations is Visualization in data analysis.\n\nGetting feedback from your guests and making further improvement is like validation against the real data and model improvisation.\n\nThis is my way of explaining data science, I am not saying this how it has to be. Every other person will have their own theory and my respect to all of them.\nHope you like this.\n #datascience üí°",,,

21985,2020-07-07 19:34:15,Suchitra Majumdar ( 1118069939 )," It depends on use case Ishita . Sometimes Type 1 error is more critical and sometimes type 2 error is critical..\n\nfor example, in case of spam detection, predicting non spam as spam is not acceptable as we may lose some important mails which are falsely detected as spam. This type of error is called False Positive, i,e Type 1 error, which is not acceptable at all as we dont want to lose some important mail which are falsely classified as spam , at the same type its ok to compromise with type 2 error, coz detectig spam as not spam may not lead to loss of information, it is just that the spam mail will get added to not spam folder..\nIn second case, for example, covid detection, diagnosing covid patient as negative, which means, not suffering from covid, is highly dangerous, as the patient may nt take proper care medication to cure themselves as they were told that they are not suffering from covid. this is very dangerous error, tis type of error is called as false negative, which means patient has been falsely detected as not suffering from covid, which is also called as False Negative, In this scenario, Type 2 error is more severe. Similarly its ok with Type 1 error in covid case, as detecting non covid patient as covid patient may not lead to any severe issue, it is just that patient will take extra care as the patient may b in impression that he/she is suffering from covid \nHope that helps u clear ur understanding :)",21983.0,,

Switching framework later won't be an issue because you'll know what you're doing.

PS: pytorch is more popular because it has been on the scene before tensorflow. and more research paper tend to write their code using pytorch.
Tensorflow popularity has increased just recently.
It's okay to learn whatever you choose. Framework should not be an issue. Main thing is the concept",22466.0,,

22488,2020-07-09 10:57:47,Chayan Kathuria ( 1052881474 ),There are some evaluation metrics for regression and some for Classification. For Regression mostly the negative mean squared or r square score is used. If you are talking about only the Classification then the evaluation metrics doesn't depend on the algorithm. It depends on what your problem is. If it requires to maximize recall or it requires precision or it requires the accuracy. You need to know that and only then evaluate.,22459.0,,

But i have also tried to participate in kaggle competition. 
I am able to train the data on train.csv but I don't know how to use that model to make predictions on test.csv

I have seen many notebooks on kaggle and there are different techniques like some people merge the train.csv & test.csv before data cleaning
I don't know its true or not but I have heard somewhere that both the csv files should not be merged in the beginning

This can lead to misleading statistical inference. I n a nut shell it leads to higher bias and higher variance but the goal is to have a generalised model thus minimum variance and with minimum bias. To correct the multicollinearity problem there are  alot of remedial measures we can employ and one of them is Ridge regression. With Ridge regression, it produces minimum variance and larger bias. Thus it only reduces the variance and nothing happens to the bias.",24189.0,,

If so, you can safely remove them. We don't use such feature for modelling. And also, we don't create new features out of them.

If it is categorical, just label encode them.

Before you start feature engineering, do proper analysis on the columns.
- find the type of a column
- is it categorical, continuous, datetime or Unique Identifiers?

Only after the above analysis are done, continue with null value imputation, handling outliers, feature engineering, etc.

27651,2020-07-24 14:38:16,Santhosh Reddy ( 1210073458 ),DL is much more advanced and complex than ML.,,,

27662,2020-07-24 14:45:36,Tony Gunk ( 1051005619 ),It happens on both but mostly in polynomial. That would be my bet,27659.0,,
27663,2020-07-24 14:45:51,Sameer Singh ( 1291193445 ),I asked the exact same question to both Krish and the support staff of INeuron and they said that it's okay if you don't know ML.,27658.0,,

Final leaf node made us to reach our decision for rating on basis on different factors we have considered while reaching to that node.
