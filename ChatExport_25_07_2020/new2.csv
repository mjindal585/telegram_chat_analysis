I have a data set with 10 columns, all of them are categorical in nature. I have done missing value treatment, outlier treatment and label encoding to convert from categorical to numerical data type.
Can someone help me with what approach to I need to take further to draw inferences from this data and make a ML algorithm? I have recently started working on ML and I am still learning, hence the ask. 

I know we cannot directly use .corr() using pearsons method on categorical variables, neither will linear regression work here. Logistic regression may be? Can some one point me in the right direction here? any help, suggestions, even links to articles would be highly appreciated.

1. You can generate few images using data augmentation.

I could notice that when I left my text data unprocessed ( without doing any text cleaning), my simple roberta- base gives my better score because there\'s one of  parameters of this model called ""reprocessing_input_data"" which I set to TRUE. And another one ""do_lower_case"" which I also set to TRUE. But in all, I am still not satisfied with my final score from this model. So I am wondering how best can we do a simple text cleaning to assist the performance of this simple transformer ( Roberta-base or even roberta-large as well) in order to improve my Log_loss score. My colleagues had improved their scores to Log_loss = 0.28 with the aid of text cleaning method(which is unknown to me) to assist this model performance. I heard that not all usual method of text preprocessing will work for this simple transformer ( Roberta-base or large) because it has it\'s own way of reprocessing input data but however one can still do a bit of text reprocessing on his own to aid the model performance. My Log_loss stuck at 0.37 without any personal text preprocessing or cleaning. The project is based on Multi label text classification. \nHow best can I do text cleaning to aid this simple Roberta-base/ large model knowingfully well that it has it\'s own embedded method of reprocessing input data through parameters called ""reprocessing_input_data"" and ""do_lower_case"" respectively.\nI will like to hear from you the trick behind this because I know that you understood this Roberta architecture very well. \nHere\'s my Gmail: ', {'type': 'email', 'text': 'sotundeadeyinka@gmail.com'}, ' for any response on this.\nApart from YouTube, I also follow you on telegram where we discuss so many things on data science.\nBut I will love to hear from you wether in private, personal via my Gmail or via this telegram discussion platform right here.\nI know this might be a resounding breakthrough on this project for every one on this data science journey.\n \nThanks.']",Adeyinka Michael Sotunde,984310618,,,

For eg: I was trying to search for a link that I had seen yesterday I had to scroll all the way up , still couldn't find it. Krish, I recommend you to use discord as it more manageable as we can create separate rooms for discussion, project sharing or joblinks sharing. If you see this please create a discord channel and invite us asap. That would help a lot for all of us.",Sushan Bastola,902782092,,,

15344,2020-06-19T14:10:47,"Phone List Given a list of phone numbers, determine if it is consistent in the sense that no number 
is the prefix of another. Let’s say the phone catalogue listed these numbers: 
• Emergency 911 
• Alice 97 625 999 
• Bob 91 12 54 26 
In this case, it’s not possible to call Bob, because the central would direct your call to the emergency  
line as soon as you had dialled the first three digits of Bob’s phone number. So this list would not  
be consistent. 
Input 
The first line of input gives a single integer, 1 <= t <= 40, the number of test cases. Each test case  
starts withn, the number of phone numbers, on a separate line, 1 <= n <= 10000. Then  
follows n lines with one unique phone number on each line. A phone number is a sequence of at  
most ten digits. 
Output 
For each test case, output “YES” if the list is consistent, or “NO” otherwise.",SURESH K,761980720,,,

15469,2020-06-19T18:39:06,"During my research internship in IIT Kharagpur, I was working on Advanced CNN. My dataset values were skewed so the accuracy was not getting high. I tried to understand very hard why it was happening, tried all the optimization process but little to no progress. My professor took one look at my work and through the confusion matrix he understood that the data was skewed because he was very good in reading and understanding data. I fixed that and my accuracy went up to 90%. So understanding data is very important. Im not from stat background so I still struggle through it. But I get better everyday by giving equal time to stats.",Meet,996184127,,,

18183,2020-06-24T20:14:58,"Say you're doing a binary classification project. Where one class is success, the other is failure. 
This is a bernoulli process.
To assess the no. of successes, for a given no. of bernoulli trials, and given probability of success, you can find it via binomial distribution.
So it'll help you analyze your model better.

I guess that makes statistics important enough. :)",Balaka Biswas,953915392,18179,,

Let's say, we have trained a model on a dataset and evaluate it and got 90% accuracy. 

When we retrain the model again with the same dataset and evaluate it, the accuracy changes. 

It's because the ML algo's shuffle the dataset while training. And that shuffling is based on a random number sequence. 

So, every time the model is trained, the random number sequence varies and the steps vary in the gradient descent (order of steps). Which leads to a different optimums, which implies a change in accuracy.
 
To evaluate a model in a right way, we should set the seed, so that same sequence is generated every time,and we can focus on other (hyper parameter tuning, etc)",Jagadeesh Suggula,709311005,19831,,

We have trained a model with 4 features and got an accuracy of 80%.(call this model A)

Imagine, we have trained the above models with setting a same seed (call it C & D).  And they got accuracy of 81% & 80%.

They may give you some probability question based on Bayes theorem. And they may ask about statistical term like hypothesis, P-value.... Etc.. Like this... Next coming to project they mostly ask about model metrics (for ex precision, recall,..etc ) for both regression and classification problem. You should be very clear on that.. One common question is bias varience trade off....They may ask about the model you have used in your project like explain your model..like this. And they will mostly focused on your project only.... Next they give you some case studies you have to provide a solution for that ( in this type of question approach is more important than solution). They may ask about guess estimation and puzzles...

Because you can develop relationship with them and when you have relationship especially with the higher-ups, you can get a raise, you are seen, that is the most important part. When you have a relation with someone, you will learn a lot especially with the positive people, plus you can get lots of help, thanks to nepotism / favouritism. The higher-ups will know whether you are a golden apple or not when you are purely motivated and driven without helps of others and money. In here the fact you are going there just to help, really make others think twice.

But here is the requirement to make sure it is a success, the community there isn’t all messed up (dull in management, talent), you must focus on developing relationship, you are highly driven and are a high performer (Highly driven and performing is something that is rare), you must focus on delivering value which sometimes is exhausting and lastly is to make sure that you can scale your income there, whether it is long term or short term. You also need to counter fear.

This is a brief road path to success, if you are unable to achieve those, simply means that you won’t be able maximise the meter of success. The trouble I have with this assumption is that I don’t know whether it is realistic or not cuz I’m not in the workforce yet.

If you are talking about only the Classification then the evaluation metrics doesn't depend on the algorithm. It depends on what your problem is.

As a college student, what should i expect from the industry, the work culture and the salaries after i pass out.(Right now i am in 3rd year of my BSc computer science from DU and going to pursue Msc in the same). Does hard work isnt paying off in software industries as in other areas or is it just that we are bad at producing code so we should expect this low salaries.

So I learned pandas, numpy, matplotlib libraries and also did a data science course on coursera by Michigan University, in which the assignment gave me so much hands-on training. Now I am doing a course for learning tableau for data visualization.
So my concern to you all is please provide me with some of the best strategies for moving forward in this field like doing a basic machine learning project or learning some other library which you think is very important for me. Also I learned two three machine learning algorithms as well so do you think I should start a project and keep learning along with that.

If so, you can safely remove them. We don't use such feature for modelling. And also, we don't create new features out of them.

If it is categorical, just label encode them.

Before you start feature engineering, do proper analysis on the columns.
- find the type of a column
- is it categorical, continuous, datetime or Unique Identifiers?

Only after the above analysis are done, continue with null value imputation, handling outliers, feature engineering, etc.

I have thought of some advanced projects ideas on which i want to build a team with we can work and can implement them.

Since I have interest only in Machine learning and deep learning , is there any possible way that I can move to these fields later within the organization. ? Do they have machine learning departments??  Does RPA works without machine learning ..? I hope these fields comes under the domin Ai ...

27951,2020-07-25T11:58:35,Decision tree checks the different factors for gini or IG gain or we can say like that which factor gives maximum differentiation between different rating will be chosen as root node and same process follows with rest of the factors for building decision tree. .. if we talk about one decision tree then that won't be enough because it's greedy algo and check for current local minima instead of global minima and there are overfitting issues with single decision tree. Final leaf node made us to reach our decision for rating on basis on different factors we have considered while reaching to that node.
